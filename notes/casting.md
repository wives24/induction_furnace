Casting 101: [Lundgren Bronze Studios](https://www.youtube.com/@lundgrenbronzestudios)
- Investment: Ultra-vest investment from Ransom and randolph
	- Rio grande jewlery supply
	- can use vacuum casting (to suck metal in)
- metal shrinkage: add resevoir of metal directly above large cavities
- brass vs bronze
	- both good casting, brass is more common but has more toxic zinc
	- bronze has little to no zinc and is easier to weld
