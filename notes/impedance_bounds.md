1. No crucible (air core): max Q --> most stressfull of the resonant tank
2. Empty crucible: Highest thermal shock
3. Full crucible of high electrical conductivity

Misc cases
- ferromagnetic materials

Interested in up to 1400C

- [MTI corp](https://mtixtl.com/products/high-purity-cylindrical-graphite-crucible-multiple-variables)
    - 1.0e-5 Ohm-m
- 0.5-1.5e-4 Ohm-m


Copper
- 2e-8 Ohm m at room temp
- 10e-8 Ohm m just before melting (doubling after)
